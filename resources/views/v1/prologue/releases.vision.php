                            The framework follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer) to clearly identify changes in each version. According to SemVer, the version number has the format <code>MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</code>:

                                    <code>MAJOR</code>: Major version, incremented for incompatible API changes.

                                    <code>MINOR</code>: Minor version, introduces new features in a backward-compatible manner.

                                    <code>PATCH</code>: Patch version, includes bug fixes without introducing new features.

                            At present, Dreamfork doesn't have a dedicated update mechanism akin to Composer packages. However, fear not - the process of updating the framework to the latest version is generally straightforward and reversible. Even in major versions, there's a high likelihood that over 90% of your application will remain compatible, and necessary adjustments will be minimal.

                            To update your project to the current version of the framework, follow these steps:
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="visit-changelog">
                            <a href="#visit-changelog">Visit Changelog</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Head to the <a href="/docs/1.x/changelog">Changelog</a> section, where each update is briefly described, including the implementation steps for your project.
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="review-changes">
                            <a href="#review-changes">Review Changes</a>
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Familiarize yourself with the changes introduced in the latest version, paying attention to any backward compatibility considerations.
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="backup-your-project">

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Before proceeding with the update, create a backup of your project to safeguard against any unforeseen issues. This way if any critical issues arise, you can roll back to the previous version.
                        </p>
                        <h4 id="testing">
                            <a href="#testing">Testing</a>

                        <p>
                            Test your project thoroughly after the update to ensure that all functionalities work as expected.
                        </p>

                                While Dreamfork strives to make updates seamless, always exercise caution and carefully review the Changelog for specific guidance on implementing updates in your project.
